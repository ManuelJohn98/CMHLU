There are three files that are of importance to this model.

1. mRSA.py
    - This file contains the class mRSA, which implements all the main functionality of this model.
2. utils.py
    - This file contains all sorts of helper functions that are not required to be instance methods. For example, the function that plots all the different distributions is located in there.
3. main.py
    - This file contains all the necessary functionality to run this project via the command line. This can be done by either running main.py or mRSA.py.
